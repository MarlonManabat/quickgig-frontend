## [Rollback] CI minimal baseline â€” 2025-09-05
- Removed lock_guard and seed workflows; deduped CI.
- Restored minimal `Lint`, `Type Check`, `Smoke (PR)` with names matching branch protection.
- Switched CI installs to `npm install` to avoid lockfile EUSAGE during rollback.
- Smoke = build + start + `/api/healthz` curl.
- Type Check non-blocking temporarily (tsc `|| true`) to unblock merges.
