# Credits Flow

Newly registered employers receive **3 posting credits**. Posting a job consumes one credit.

When credits reach zero, attempts to access the job posting form are gated with options to buy credits via manual GCash, contact support, or return home.

Admins may top up credits through the `/admin/credits` page which uses the `grant_credits` RPC. Payments are handled offline through the Manual GCash flow.
