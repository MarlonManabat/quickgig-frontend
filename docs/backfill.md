# Backfill / Change Log (Landing → App routing)

## 2025-09-03
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` and `src/lib/urls.ts` utility to centralize the app host.
- Converted all landing CTAs (hero, nav, footer, and cards) to absolute links to the app:
  - `/browse-jobs`, `/gigs/create`, `/applications`, `/login`.
- Introduced landing `middleware.ts` that **keeps** marketing homepage on `/`
  but **redirects** the app paths above to the canonical app host with HTTP **308**.
- Added Playwright smoke test `tests/smoke/landing-to-app.spec.ts` to ensure links open on `app.quickgig.ph`.
- Product-first guardrails:
  - Do **not** change or remove app routes/middleware in this repo.
  - Keep landing homepage content and SEO intact.
  - Any future landing CTA that targets an app feature **must** use `appUrl('/path')`.
