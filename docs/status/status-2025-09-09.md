# Status â€” 2025-09-09

## Summary
- Added non-blocking **Status Report** workflow that posts guardrail results to the PR summary.
- No changes to app code, tests, or gating workflows.

## What must stay true (current contract)
- Canonical app routes: **/browse-jobs**, **/gigs/create**, **/applications**, **/login**.
- Signed-out flows that land on **/login?next=<dest>** are considered **success** in smoke.
- Header & hero CTAs use central **ROUTES** + **toAppPath()** and stable test IDs for desktop & mobile nav.

## How to verify locally
- Guardrails: `bash scripts/no-legacy.sh` and `node scripts/check-cta-links.mjs`
- Smoke: `npx playwright test -c playwright.smoke.ts`
