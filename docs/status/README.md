# Status Reports

This folder contains daily status snapshots generated by `.github/workflows/status-report.yml`.

**Contract (must stay true)**:
- Canonical routes: `/browse-jobs`, `/post-job`, `/applications`, `/login`
- Auth-aware redirects to `/login?next=<dest>` are acceptable success cases for gated pages in smoke tests.
- `/gigs/create` is legacy and *not* canonical.

Run manually: *Actions → Status Report → Run workflow*.
